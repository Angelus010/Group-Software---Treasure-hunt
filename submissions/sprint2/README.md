This is a submission for Sprint 1. There are three types of document that you will find the following places.

## PROCESS DOCUMENTS
Our process documents of which includes the Kanban board are managed using Trello. All group members equally contributed, discussing their ideas surrounding the mechanics, technical design and features of the game. Additions to the backlog of the Kanban board were made every time all group members agreed on an idea.

On top of this, we have taken screenshots of each progression of the Kanban board to illustrate as well as log progress. This is all saved within our GitHub repository.

## TECHNICAL DOCUMENTS
All our technical documents are managed on GitHub. We have categorized technical components of our project into both front-end code for gamekeepers and standard players, and a separate file for server code. Currently, within these directories, we have boilerplate code to assist in the development of our project.
