This is a submission for Sprint 2. There are three types of document that you will find the following places.

## PROCESS DOCUMENTS
Our process documents of which includes the Kanban board are managed using Trello. For this sprint, some reform in terms of our process documentation has been made based off of feedback; new ideas and revamps of old ones to suit more realistic goals were made, proper prioritisation of backlog tasks were allocated, the addition of DONE columns were introduced to the Kanban board and the creation of a development policy for all members in the group to follow has been established.

As per usual, we have taken some screenshots of each progression of the Kanban board to illustrate as well as log progress. This is all saved within our GitHub repository.

Furthermore, we have taken note of every meeting our group has made, including attendance, agenda and duration. These logs can also be found within our GitHub repository.

## PRODUCT DOCUMENTS
So far, our product documents take the form of a digital UI concept, early physical sketches of the UI, a UML diagram and now as of this sprint, an easily digestible, abstract documentation of our design for our planned system. These designs can also be found within our GitHub repository.
