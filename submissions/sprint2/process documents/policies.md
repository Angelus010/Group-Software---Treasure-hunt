## Contributing

We are using pull requests to manage the code base, this is so we can review each other's code and work together more easily. The basic process goes like this:

1. Raise an issue on github of what you are doing to let everyone know.

2. Create a new branch off of the tip of `master` branch.

3. Work on your feature/fix on that branch.

4. Once finished push the branch to github.

5. Raise a pull request on github to the `master` branch and assign the person you believe most fit to, to review your code.

6. Once your pull request is reviewed and accepted, it can be merged back into master.

## Notes

- We are using husky and lint-staged to ensure coding style is consistant, if you cannot commit your code check your styling.

- Use the "commit early, commit often" practice. You can read about that and other best pratices with git [here](https://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/).

- When writing commit messages write it as the ending to this sentance: "This commit will...", always start with a capital letter and keep them to 72 characters maximum. If you need longer consider making a commit description in a new paragraph.
