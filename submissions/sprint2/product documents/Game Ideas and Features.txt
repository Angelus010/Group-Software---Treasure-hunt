Summary:
The basic idea for the treasure hunt game is for students to find a location
in the university map which has been chosen by the gamekeeper. If the student
thinks that they are in the right place, they can click on a button in the app
to see how far away they are from the location. The gamekeeper can also place
clue markers on the map, which will give players additional information about
the target location when they are close enough to the clue markers.

Our minimum viable product is an app which allows a gamekeeper to specify a
location for a player to find and for the player to be able to verify that
they have found the correct location through the use of geolocation. Our MVP
will also allow the gamekeeper to put clue markers on the map. When players get
close enough to a clue marker, they will be given some information to help them
find their location. For example, they might be given an image of the location,
or the map could be updated to show a region where the location could be.

Of course we are planning on many more additional features such as a more
sophisticated verification system, a scoring system and additional tasks for
the players such as location-specific questions.

Features:

Must have:
-Basic UI for both player and gamekeeper
-Implementation of Google Maps API and geolocation to track players
-System for the gamekeeper to mark main locations
-System for the gamekeeper to mark hint locations
-System for player to check their distance from target location

Should have:
-A scoring system (could give students higher scores depending on factors such
as distance from location, time or any other additional objectives completed)
-A "Hunt The Thimble" guidance system for the clue markers (will let the
students know they are getting "hotter" the closer they get to the clue or
"colder" if they are getting further away)
-Additional objectives - e.g. have students answer a question relating to their
course or the university in general when they are at a hint location to get
their clue or when they are at their target location to earn extra points.
-A system for the gamekeeper to create teams
-A one-time key system for players to be able to quickly join a team
-An FAQ

Could have:
-A leaderboard system
-An implementation of a timer

(probably) Won't have:
-Art assets for the UI
-Additional themes for the UI
