Accessibility:

We need to consider students with accessibility needs when choosing which
locations to include in our app. For example, the Forum has automatic doors and 
there are many paths to the forum which do not require any stairs to be taken.
Also, the Forum is very spacious and contains an elevator so in general, the
forum is a very accessible location. Because of this, the forum and other
important locations within the forum such as the library, SID and the career
zone are great locations to include in the app because of their ease of
accessibility and their importance to students regardless of their course.
Locations such as these could be a part of every student's search, but this may
cause problems as there may be too many students in these locations at a given
time.

The Harrison building is very important for Computer Science students but the
front entrance is not very accessible as it has stairs leading to the entrance
but no ramp. However, there is a rear entrance with a ramp and the
building contains an elevator.
